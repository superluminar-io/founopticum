This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* Deploy {partner-product-short-name} at once: All features are enabled by default and are installed.
* Deploy {partner-product-short-name} iteratively with feature flippers: Only certain features are enabled at a time. This option is useful when you want to test the impact of introducing certain features iteratively.
